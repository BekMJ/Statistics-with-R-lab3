# Task 1

WD

```{r}
getwd()
```

# Task 2

```{r}
spruce.df = read.csv("SPRUCE.csv")
head(spruce.df)
```

# Task 3

## o	Make a scatter plot of the data (y axis will be the Height).
```{r}
plot(Height~BHDiameter, data = spruce.df, main = "Height vs BHDiameer", pch = 21, bg ="Blue", cex = 1.2, ylim=c(0, 1.1*max(Height)),xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)))
```

## Does there appear to be a straight line relationship?

There definetly is a positive relationship between Height and BHDiameter, although I still can't be sure it is a straight line relationship.

## o	Load the library s20x and make a lowess smoother scatter plot using trendscatter() (try a few values of f, f=0.5,0.6,0.7) record all three plots, use layout().

```{r}
library(s20x)
layout(matrix(1:4,nr=2,nc=2,byrow=TRUE))
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter,f=0.5, data=spruce.df)
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter,f=0.6, data=spruce.df)
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter,f=0.7, data=spruce.df)


```

## o	We will assume (this may in fact be a bad assumption) a straight line relationship, use lm and make a linear model object, call it spruce.lm 

```{r}
spruce.lm = lm(Height~BHDiameter, data = spruce.df)
summary(spruce.lm)
```


## o	Make a new scatter plot and add the least squares regression line to the points -abline(spruce.lm) â€“ record the plot.


```{r}

```
